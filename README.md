Please keep in mind I did not purchase an API key, so images are not loading. If you run the app locally, the images load just fine.

To run app locally, clone repo and run ```ruby app.rb``` from the root of the repo directory. This will fire up the sinatra server on port 4567. Open a browser and go to localhost:4567.
